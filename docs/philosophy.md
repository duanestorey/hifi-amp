## Philosophy

The current version of the amplifier is designed to provide a great listening experience for anyone who predominantly listens to music and movies with a 2.1 system (two channels plus a subwoofer).  Since I recently entered into the realm of building my own speakers, I also did a final iteration on the amplifier so that I could add active crossovers to the amplifier itself.  Since the goal of this entire project was to open-source it, I also tried my best to not rely on third-party or commercial components for any functionality.

A project like this is never finished, and I hope each year to continue to refine and improve it.  I also hope a few members of the community will also try to build it, and a small community of music enthusiasts can enjoy it all together.
