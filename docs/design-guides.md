## Design Guides

The following are the primary design principles for the amplifier that will be applied to all new boards and future revisions.

### LED lights and resistors

The following voltages and LED colours should be used for consistency. In general, all LEDs are set at 2ma of current and should be 0603 size.

#### Digital Voltages

- 3.3V - Blue, set to ~2ma using 150R 
- 5.0V - Red, set to ~2ma using 1.3K

#### Analog Voltages

* +3.3V - Yellow, set to ~2ma using 620R
* +9.5V - Yellow, set to ~2ma using 3.6K
* -9.5V - Blue, set to ~2ma using 3.3K
* +34V - Yellow, set to ~2ma using 16K
* -34V - Blue, set to ~2ma using 16K
* Positive DC - Yellow, set to 2ma
* Negative DC - Blue, set to 2ma
