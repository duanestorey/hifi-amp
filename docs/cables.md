## Cables & Connectors

The following are the cables, connectors, and interconnects used with this project.

### JST-PH (2.00 Pitch)

JST-PH connectors are used for most small signal and low power signals. These connectors have a 2.0mm pitch and come in various sizes.  The maximum amount of current per pin is limited to 2A.

### JST-XH (2.54 Pitch)

JST-XH connectors are used for the all the digital audio inputs, such as SPDIF. These connectors have a 2.54mm pitch and come in various sizes.  The maximium amount of current per pin is limited to 3A.

### JST-VH (3.96mm Pitch)

JST-VH connectors are used for the all the high current power lines, as well as a few important grounds. These connectors have a 3.96m pitch and come in various sizes. The maximium amount of current per pin is limited to 10A.

### RCA Inputs and Outputs

The analog and SPDIF inputs into the amplifier use a standard RCA plug which has a shield and a hot wire. 

### XLR Audio Connector

Several XLR audio connectors are used in the project.  

A 7-pin connector is used between the amplifier and each monoblock, and has the following pin designation.

| Pin # | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 1 | Shield |
| 2 | Power Ground |
| 3 | +POWER (32V) |
| 4 | -POWER (-32V) |
| 5 | SDA |
| 6 | SDL |
| 7 | 3.3V |

A 5-pin connector is also used between the amplifier and each monoblock, and has the following pin designation.

| Pin # | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 1 | Shield |
| 2 | Signal Ground |
| 3 | Woofer Signal |
| 4 | Tweeter Signal |
| 5 | Enable |
