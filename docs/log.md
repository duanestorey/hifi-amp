## Log

This is chronological log of everything I've done on the project.  I'll backfill it as I go, but will also use it to keep track of changes/additions and the thought process along the way.

### Updates

* February 14, 2025: I tried connecting to the INA260 power meter ICs but I was getting inconsisent results.  After consulting with the datasheet and my schematic, I was pretty sure I was using it correctly. I decided that it might be due to using some ICs I got from China, so I redid the board using INA260s purchased from Mouser - low and behold they started working properly.  So mental note, don't use ICs from Aliexpress.
