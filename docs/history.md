## History

Back in my third year of university at UBC, one of my roommates, Chad, came back one summer and showed us all a vacuum-tube based amplifier he built over the summer. Most of us were absolutely amazed that someone we knew built this magical device that transformed electricity into sound.  

Ever since I saw that, I was determined to eventually build an amplifier myself.  While I've spent most of my life doing software, and obtained a master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I've always wished I did more hardware during and after university.  Unfortunately while I enjoyed my university education, I didn't really obtain any practical experience in electrical engineering.

When COVID19 happened, I was in Spain and mostly confined in my apartment for months on end. During that time, I decided to start working on this amplifier project. It started as a digitally-enhanced two-channel vacuum tube amplifier, but eventually morphed over time into it's current form based on how I actually listen to music and watch movies.  At one point the amplifier tried to support a full 5.1 dolby digital solution, but it seemed like overkill and created more problems than it solved.

This is version 1.0 of this entire amplifier project. As time goes on, I hope to continue to improve and refine it based on feedback from others.
