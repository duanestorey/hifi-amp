## History

Back in my third year of university at UBC, one of my roommates, Chad, came back one summer and showed us all a vacuum-tube based amplifier he built over the summer. Most of us were absolutely amazed that someone we knew built this magical device that transformed electricity into sound.  

Ever since I saw that, I was determined to eventually build an amplifier myself.  While I've spent most of my life doing software, and obtained a master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I've always wished I did more hardware during and after university.  Unfortunately while I enjoyed my university education, I didn't really obtain any practical experience in electrical engineering.

When COVID19 happened, I was in Spain and mostly confined in my apartment for months on end. During that time, I decided to start working on this amplifier project. It started as a digitally-enhanced two-channel vacuum tube amplifier, but eventually morphed over time into it's current form based on how I actually listen to music and watch movies.  At one point the amplifier tried to support a full 5.1 dolby digital solution, but it seemed like overkill and created more problems than it solved.

The current version of the amplifier is designed to provide a great listening experience for anyone who predominantly listens to music and movies with a 2.1 system (two channels plus a subwoofer).  Since I recently entered into the realm of building my own speakers, I also did a final iteration on the amplifier so that I could add active crossovers to the amplifier itself.  Since the goal of this entire project was to open-source it, I also tried my best to not rely on third-party or commercial components for any functionality.

A project like this is never finished, and I hope each year to continue to refine and improve it.  I also hope a few members of the community will also try to build it, and a small community of music enthusiasts can enjoy it all together.
